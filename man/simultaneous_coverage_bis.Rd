\title{Simultaneous Coverage Evaluation (bis version)}
\usage{
simultaneous_coverage_bis(R_max, Beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{R_max}{A numeric vector of maximum ranks for each element in the score matrix.
This represents the rank of residuals or error terms used for uncertainty estimation.}

\item{Beta}{A numeric value between 0 and 1. It represents the coverage parameter, which
controls the desired level of confidence in the prediction intervals.}
}
\value{
A numeric value representing the proportion of the elements in \code{R_max} that are
less than or equal to the threshold \code{ceil(Beta * (n + 1))}. This is the coverage
estimate for the uncertainty method.
}
\description{
This function evaluates the proportion of elements in the R_max vector that are
less than or equal to the threshold \code{ceil(Beta * (n + 1))}, where \code{n} is the
number of elements in the R_max vector. This is a modified version of the standard
simultaneous coverage that uses a dynamic threshold based on \code{Beta} and the size of \code{R_max}.
}
\examples{
R_max <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)  # Example R_max vector
Beta <- 0.8  # Example Beta value
coverage <- simultaneous_coverage_bis(R_max, Beta)
cat("Simultaneous Coverage:", coverage, "\n")
